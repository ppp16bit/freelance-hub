### hi :)

i will share the development process of this challenge that I found on social media

## Objective: Freelancer Management Platform
The platform will allow clients to register projects and freelancers to apply to carry them out. The system will manage proposals, allow negotiations and record the completion of work.

## Challenge Requirements
- The application must be built using **Java 11+**.
- Use **Spring Boot** or another framework of your choice.
- Relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
- RESTful API following good API design practices.
- Implement unit and integration tests.
- Proper use of logs and error handling.
- API documentation using **Swagger** or similar.

## Differentials (i will work on this later)
- Use of **Docker** for development environment.
- Decoupled architecture (Controller, Service, Repository layers, etc.).
- Implementation of messaging with RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- Cache to optimize frequent queries.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions or another tool.
- Automated deployment to a cloud service.
